// Auxiliary plan for TakePanorama.  Pans and tilts to specified angle
// and takes a picture.

// NOTE: The recent addition of a TiltAngle input has made the file
// and node names a misnomer.  However, in practice as of 11/14/22,
// this node is used only to pan while maintaining the current tilt.
// A renaming is pending discussion of re-introducing separate Pan and
// Tilt commands.
